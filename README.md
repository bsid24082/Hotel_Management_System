# Hotel_Management_System

HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

INTRODUCTION
We chose the hotel industry as our domain. We tried to implement basic Python concepts and build an application which could help the hotels in managing their day to day activities. The application can perform activities like booking a room, letting customers order food, totalling their bill, checking their payment status and recording all these activities.

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
The purpose of the project is to understand how python can be used in real-world scenarios, in this case, hotels. The aim was to develop a program which is more user friendly and even stores data for the future use of both the customer and the hotel admins. The main purpose of this assignment was to make us understand how simple components like loops, lists, operators, conditional statements, user defined functions, etc can be used to develop programs which makes our day to day lives easier and these tedious process efficient. The project also gives us a glimpse into how data is can be storted in different way. 

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND STEPWISE EXPLANATION
1) Libraries used
2) List Declaration
   We defined the following lists
   - name :- It is a list which has the name of all the customers
   - phone_no :- It is a list which has the phone number of all the customers

   - room :- It is a list which has the type of room each customer stayed in
   - price :- The list has data about the price of the room they stayed in
   - room_no :- It is a list which has the information of the room number each customer stayed in
   - cust_id :- It is a unique customer ID which is assigned to each customer
   - Num_days :- The number of days each customer stayed which is calculated using check-in and check-out date
   - rc :- It is the amount of money each customer spent at the restaurnt during their stay
   - p :- It is the payment status. If p = 0, payment is not done and if p = 1, then payment has been made
   - r :- It is a list which has the individual food items price which is then used to calculate the final price  
4) Functions Defined
   - date()
   - Booking() 
   - Rooms_Info()
   - Menu_Card()
   - Payment_portal()
   - BK_Records()
   - addto()
   - Display()
