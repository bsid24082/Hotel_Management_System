# Hotel_Management_System

HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

INTRODUCTION
We chose the hotel industry as our domain. We tried to implement basic Python concepts and build an application which could help the hotels in managing their day to day activities. The application can perform activities like booking a room, letting customers order food, totalling their bill, checking their payment status and recording all these activities.

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
The purpose of the project is to understand how python can be used in real-world scenarios, in this case, hotels. The aim was to develop a program which is more user friendly and even stores data for the future use of both the customer and the hotel admins. The main purpose of this assignment was to make us understand how simple components like loops, lists, operators, conditional statements, user defined functions, etc can be used to develop programs which makes our day to day lives easier and these tedious process efficient. The project also gives us a glimpse into how data is can be storted in different way.
